## Overview

This is a front-end mentor challenge; building QR-code and also experience. 
It helps a lot in the number one thing everyone needs in learning a new skill: **`PRACTICE.`**  

## My process

I started with the HTML, creating and adding contents like the stylesheet link, the divs and images, all placed in correlation to one another before styling.
While styling, I added more content to the HTML to help in the styling else it wouldn't have been positioned properly.
I added comments to tell what was what both for me and other people who will peruse the code(and to also get used to it).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to use google fonts while writing this code, I know it's not much but I'm really proud of this little achievement.
I refreshed my memory on box model, how `width/height`,`margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `content` relate to one another to make the `box sizing`.
I also learnt how to use font awesome icons, not particularly for the project, but I was inspired by this project.
Overall, my coding xp has gone up a notch.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Edu+NSW+ACT+Foundation&family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Continued development

Increase my skill on CSS flexbox and grid, and generally the CSS layout is paramount.
